## About me

My name is Robert Colley and I am excited about using cutting edge web and mobile technology to create platforms and solutions to solve the world's problems. I am passionate about React Native, React, JavaScript, and the future of application and open source development. Most of my work is done in private repositories for work, but I would be happy to discuss my experiences and knowlege.

My blog can be found at [www.robertjcolley.com](https://robertjcolley.com). I tend to write longer form posts here about things other than programming, but I do have a section just for programming.
